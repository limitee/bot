----------------------------------------------------
Advanced AutoUpgrader component which allows to create auto-upgradable
software without single line of code! It contains built-in "Application
Update Wizard", built-in multi-language support (it automatically recognize
language used on user's PC and show all messages in native language).
Current version automatically translates all wizard's contents to 25
languages: English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Italian,
Dutch, Danish, Finnish, Chinese and many others. However, if you
don't want to use built-in Wizard, you still can make customized
progress-dialogs using numerous events.

If you store newer version of your program in password protected Web
directories, you can pre-configure the username/password to access files, or
let AutoUpgrader to ask login information when it necessary.

With AutoUpgrader your customers will use only latest versions of your
software! Package contains two bonus components from AppControls pack:

introduced in RFC1867, Internet Explorer's cache etc) and auThread (easy to
use thread component which also works on ActiveForms of D6 and D7).
